# WebScraping-Introduction

These are the code files (some notes and some projects too) from 2021 back when I was first learning about web scraping. Back then I wasn't used to writing clean code or,  meaningful commit messages (I think I didn't even use git at first). So, now I am combining all those files and uploading them here all together.

Caution: These codes are mostly outdated. So you may use these to just take an idea but not as templates or reference material (if you do so do at your own risk).
